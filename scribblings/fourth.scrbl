@title{Fourth Tutorialâ€”Can I have a cookie?}

We start to use cookies now, an omnipresent technique for recognizability in HTTP (whereby the server can recognize that the request it's currently processing belongs to a known `user` or `session'. We also look at X-exprs, an alternative to @tt{include-template} for generating HTML. (We'll use Matthew Butterick's @tt{txexpr} library to help us generate the X-exprs.)
